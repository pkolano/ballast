Load Balancing Policies
=======================

Policies are expressions that evaluate to numeric values.  When a policy
is evaluated, the host with the lowest nonnegative value will be
returned to the client.  Hosts with negative values or whose last update
was more than host_timeout seconds in the past will be considered
down.  If more than one host has the lowest value, one will be chosen at
random.

Policy expressions are composed of terms corresponding to various load
metrics, special functions, and a subset of perl operators.  Long lines
may be broken with the line continuation operator ("\").

1. Operators

    Ballast policies support a subset of Perl operators.  See "man
    perlop" for detailed descriptions.  Precedence can be forced in the
    usual manner with parentheses.

    1.1. Arithmetic and String Operators

        ! ~ * / % + - << >> & | ^ ** abs() .

    1.2. Arithmetic Relational Operators

        < > <= >= == != <=>

    1.3. String Relational Operators

        cmp eq ge gt le lt ne

    1.4. Logical Operators

        && ||

    1.5. Conditional Operator

        ?:

    1.6. Binding Operators

        =~ !~

    1.7. Quote-like Operators

        q() qr()

            Note that only () may be used after q and qr and not any
            other dividers supported by perl (e.g. not q|this is a
            string|)


2. Functions

    Two special functions can be used to compute values across all
    sessions and associated users on each system.  Each function is
    given an expression argument, which is in the same form as a policy
    expression with the addition of some special terms that are listed
    in Section 3.3.  These functions are only available when the
    "user_load" setting has been kept enabled.

    2.1. product(expression)

        compute product of expression for all sessions on host

4. Conditional Policies

    The flexibility of Ballast policy expressions allows very advanced
    balancing policies to be specified.  A few example uses that may be
    combined arbitrarily are illustrated below.

    4.1. Client-Specific Balancing

        Balancing decisions can be made on a per-client basis using the
        client_ip term.  The basic form of a client-specific
        expression is:

            client_ip =~ qr(^10\.10\.\d+.\d+) ? expr1 : expr2

        In this case, clients on subnet 10.10.0.0/16 are balanced by
        expr1 while all other clients are balanced by expr2.  As an
        example, suppose a given border host functions as a file
        transfer proxy to internal hosts.  In this case, connections
        from that host would like to minimize I/O and network loads to
        achieve faster transfers whereas other hosts are still concerned
        with other metrics.

    4.2. Host-Specific Balancing

        Balancing decisions can be made on a per-host basis using the
        host term.  The basic form of a host-specific expression is:

            host eq q(host1) ? expr1 : expr2

        In this case, the load of host host1 is evaluated against expr1
        while all other hosts are evaluated against expr2.  As an
        example, suppose a system is being used for testing and should
        only be available if all other hosts are down.  Its expression
        can be set to a large value while others are balanced by the
        normal policy.

    4.3. User-Specific Balancing

        Balancing decision can be made on a per-user basis using the
        user_uid term.  The basic form of a user-specific expression is:

            user_uid == 1001 ? expr1 : expr2

        In this case, the user whose uid is 1001 will be balanced by
        expr1 while all other users will be balanced by expr2.  As an
        example, suppose premium/admin users are allowed to access all
        hosts while trial/normal users can only go to a certain subset.
        Additional user-specific policies are shown in the next section.

    4.4. User-Directed Balancing

        Balancing decisions can be influenced by the user (or by a
        program acting on the user's behalf) using additional arguments
        given on the command line.  The basic form of a user-directed
        expression is:

            arg0 eq q(name) ? expr1 : expr2

        In this case, if the first additional matches a predetermined
        name, expr1 will be used for balancing.  Otherwise, expr2 will
        be used.  As an example, suppose users wish to choose the
        balancing policy most relevant to each invocation.  In this
        case, an argument of "cpu" could be configured to balance by
        lowest cpu load, "mem" could be configured to balance by lowest
        memory load, etc.

    4.5. Host-Subset Balancing

        Balancing decisions can be made between a specific subset of
        hosts using additional arguments given on the command line.
        The basic form of a host-subset expression is:

            arg0 =~ (qr(^|,) . host . qr(,|$)) ? expr1 : -1

        In this case, if the first additional argument is a set of
        hosts separated by commas, any hosts contained in that set will
        be balanced by expr1 while all other hosts will be marked as
        unavailable with -1.  As an example, suppose another application
        derives a set of hosts that have a particular property that is
        beyond the scope of the balancer.  In this case, that
        application can invoke the balancer internally with that set of
        hosts to ensure that the host utilized will be available and
        have the lowest load.


5. Sample Policies

    The following sample policies corresponding to the policies
    described in the paper "doc/ballast.pdf".  Policies 5.4 to 5.8
    assume CPU load as the least load metric.

        random

    5.2. Round Robin

        It is not currently possible to specify a round robin policy.
        This will be added in the future.
