Ballast Installation and Configuration
======================================

1. Deployments

    A Ballast deployment consists of:
    
        o A Ballast agent on each host to be load balanced to collect
          load information
          
        o A Ballast server on one or more hosts to process load
          information and select hosts for clients based on configured
          policies
        
        o A Ballast client on each host that will invoke the balancer to
          request balancing decisions from the server

    Any number of load balancing aliases can be defined for any number
    of hosts.  For example, an alias "foo" might be used to invoke the
    load balancer across hosts {foo1,foo2,bar1,bar2}.  Namely, when the
    user invokes "ssh foo", Ballast will dynamically select one of
    {foo1,foo2,bar1,bar2} according to the configured load balancing
    policy for alias foo and connect to that system (e.g. foo2) as if
    the user had directly invoked "ssh foo2".


2. Prerequisites

    2.1. Host keys

        All SSH host keys across the balanced systems for a particular
        alias must be identical.  Otherwise, internal SSH host key
        checks will fail when the stored known host key for the alias
        does not match the host key offered by the selected host.  See
        "man sshd" and "man sshd_config" for details on configuring
        host keys.

        If multiple balancing aliases are defined, the host keys may
        differ between the hosts of different aliases.

    2.2. Ballast agent

        o Perl >= 5.8

    2.3. Ballast client

        2.3.1. Perl client

            o Perl >= 5.6

        2.3.2. C client

            o C      (compilation only)
            o Make   (compilation only)
            o Netcat (or equivalent such as tcpconnect from tcputils)

    2.4. Ballast server

        o Perl >= 5.8


3. Installation

    Note that /usr/local is used as the default install prefix in all
    examples, but can be changed to any other desired location.  The
    location of the config file can also be changed from /etc/ballastrc,
    but then requires that the agent, client, and/or server be invoked
    with additional parameters "-c /path/to/config/file".

    3.1. Ballast agent installation

        On each host to be load balanced:

            install -m 755 perl/ballast-agent /usr/local/sbin
            install -m 644 etc/ballastrc /etc

    3.2. Ballast client installation

        The Ballast client comes in two flavors: Perl and C.  If Perl is
        installed and available to users, the Perl version is
        recommended.  The C version is intended for systems that either
        don't have Perl installed or for which it is not generally
        accessible to users (e.g. bastion hosts with a restricted
        chroot environment).

        3.2.1. Perl client

            On each host that will invoke the balancer:

                install -m 755 perl/ballast /usr/local/bin
                install -m 644 etc/ballastrc /etc

        3.2.2. C client

            The C client must be compiled:

                make

            The Makefile assumes gcc and may need to be modified if an
            alternate compiler is installed.

            On each host that will invoke the balancer:

                install -m 755 c/ballast /usr/local/bin
                install -m 644 etc/ballastrc /etc

    3.3. Ballast server installation

        On one or more hosts:

            install -m 755 perl/ballastd /usr/local/sbin
            install -m 644 etc/ballastrc /etc

        If ballast server will be run as a systemd service:

            install -m 644 etc/systemd/system/ballast.service /etc/systemd/system
	    install -m 644 etc/systemd/system/ballast.socket /etc/systemd/system


4. Configuration

    Note that the following will assume that all Ballast components were
    installed with prefix /usr/local with the config file installed as
    /etc/ballastrc.  If installed elsewhere, paths must be changed.

    4.1. Ballast agent configuration

        4.1.1. /etc/ballastrc

            Any items listed under the agent sections in the default
            config file should be reviewed.  Any uncommented items in
            these sections must be configured (uncommented items in
            other sections can be ignored or commented out if they are
            not being used by another Ballast component).  For the
            agent, these include:

                data_alias
                data_host

            Note that the value of data_alias must match one of the
            aliases X in a "policy_X" of the server configuration.
            For example, for an alias "foo" defined by the server
            config value "policy_foo", the agent config would set
            data_alias to "foo".

            It is strongly recommended that encrypted communication be
            enabled between agents and the server.  Otherwise, the
            integrity and privacy of load data cannot be guaranteed.
            Encryption is enabled using the following two settings:

                data_cipher
                key_file

            By default, an embedded version of the XXTEA_PP cipher is
            used.  To use a different cipher X, the perl module Crypt::X
            must be installed on all agent hosts.  For example, to use
            standard AES encryption, install Crypt::Rijndael and set
            data_cipher to Rijndael.

            If many agents are scheduled to execute at the same time
            via cron, it is beneficial for agents to wait a random
            amount of time before collecting data to prevent large
            usage spikes in the server.  For this purpose the following
            setting may be used:

                random_wait

            which specifies a number of seconds to randomly wait before
            collecting and sending data to the server.

            Custom load information can be processed by the server
            using the following setting:

                load_hook

            The value for this item is the path to any executable
            program.  The program should print whitespace-separated
            key-value pairs to stdout, where the key is an alphanumeric
            value (equivalent to Perl regex "\w+") and the value is any
            text (including spaces).  For example, the following script
            (if saved to a file given as the value of load_hook) would
            add a custom field "tmp_files" that contains the number of
            top-level items in /tmp, which can be used in balancing
            policies:

                #!/bin/sh
                echo tmp_files `ls -1 /tmp |wc -l`

            Default load information collected by the agent can be
            overridden using this mechanism, if desired.

            To specify differential loads (i.e. load values where the
            difference between consecutive values indicates the load
            rather than a single value), a "d_" prefix should be added
            to the key name.  For example, to specify the number of
            top-level items in /tmp that have been added since the last
            update, use:

                #!/bin/sh
                echo d_tmp_files `ls -1 /tmp |wc -l`

            Note that this is exactly the same as the previous example
            except for the "d_" prefix, which triggers special
            processing in the server.  The original name "tmp_files"
            should still be used in policies.

            Take care with differential values that may become smaller
            between two iterations (such as the above example).  Ballast
            considers a host to be down if the balancing policy
            evaluates to a negative number.  Use the absolute value
            function "abs()" or the conditional evaluation operator
            "?:" in policies when custom values may become negative.

               use_ip_address

            If host IP address should be used rather than hostname
	    for ballast-agent to pass onto the server, then set this
	    item to a value of 1.

        4.1.2. /var/spool/cron/crontabs/agent_user (or equivalent)

            The agent does not require any special privileges to run so
            may be invoked in the crontab of any user.  The crontab will
            determine how often load data is collected.  The load
            generated by the agent is minimal so can be run every
            minute without impact.

                # collect load information every minute
                * * * * * /usr/local/sbin/ballast-agent >/dev/null 2>&1

            Note that the agent runs with Perl taint mode enabled so if
            encrypted communication is enabled and the Crypt::* modules
            are installed in a non-standard location (i.e. not listed in
            @INC by "perl -V"), then the agent must be invoked using:

                perl -T -I/module/location /usr/local/sbin/ballast-agent

    4.2. Ballast client configuration

        4.2.1. /etc/ballastrc

            Any items listed under the client sections in the default
            config file should be reviewed.  Any uncommented items in
            these sections must be configured (uncommented items in
            other sections can be ignored or commented out if they are
            not being used by another Ballast component).  For the
            client, these include:

                alias_domain
                data_host
                hosts_X (for each balancing alias X)

            Note that the hosts listed in each "hosts_X" item can be any
            subset of the actual hosts for alias X.  This value is only
            used for resiliency when the Ballast server cannot be
            contacted.  It does not need to be changed when additional
            balanced hosts are added.  Any balanced host that no longer
            exists should be removed from this setting or else may
            result in errors if the server goes down.

            The C client also requires:

                relay_path

            which is the path to a TCP relay such as netcat.  The Perl
            client has relay funtionality built-in, although it should
            be considered beta and can be replaced with an external
            utility using a relay_path setting.

        4.2.2. /etc/ssh/ssh_config

            To invoke the load balancer, each client system must have
            an entry for each balancing alias.  The following uses alias
            "foo" as an example.

                # Aliases for least loaded and last utilized system
                Host foo foo-last foo.example.com foo-last.example.com

                    # Use the balancer when connecting to these aliases
                    ProxyCommand /usr/local/bin/ballast %h

                    # Avoids host key checks for all variants when
                    # StrictHostKeyChecking is enabled (optional)
                    HostKeyAlias foo1.example.com

            Note that "example.com" must match the value of "alias_domain",
            "-last" must match the value of "alias_last" (if modified from
            the default), "foo" must match X in item "hosts_X", and "foo1"
            should match one of the values of "hosts_foo" in the config
            file.  Also note that additional arguments can be given to
            the Ballast client that will correspond to arg0...argN in
            policy definitions.

        4.2.3. ~/.ssh/config

            To invoke the load balancer from an external system through
            a bastion host, users can add the following to their
            personal ~/.ssh/config:

                # Aliases for least loaded and last utilized system
                Host foo foo-last foo.example.com foo-last.example.com

                    # Use the balancer on the bastion for these aliases
                    ProxyCommand ssh bastion.example.com /usr/local/bin/ballast %h

                    # Avoids host key checks for all variants when
                    # StrictHostKeyChecking is enabled (optional)
                    HostKeyAlias foo1.example.com

            Note that the Ballast client can be used as a
            general-purpose replacement for netcat on external systems
            even for systems that do not correspond to balancing
            aliases.  Also note that additional arguments can be given
            to the Ballast client that will correspond to arg0...argN in
            policy definitions.

    4.3. Ballast server configuration

        4.3.1. /etc/ballastrc

            Any items listed under the server sections in the default
            config file should be reviewed.  Any uncommented items in
            these sections must be configured (uncommented items in
            other sections can be ignored or commented out if they are
            not being used by another Ballast component).  For the
            server, these include:

                data_db
                policy_X (for each balancing alias X)

            Consult "doc/policy.txt" for full documentation on
            specifying balancing policies.

            Make sure that the user and/or group specified with the
            "run_user" and "run_group" settings have write access to the
            pid_file and data_db settings, if specified.

            It is strongly recommended that encrypted communication be
            enabled between agents and the server.  Otherwise, the
            integrity and privacy of load data cannot be guaranteed.
            Encryption is enabled using the following two settings:

                data_cipher
                key_file

            By default, an embedded version of the XXTEA_PP cipher is
            used.  To use a different cipher X, the perl module Crypt::X
            must be installed on all server hosts.  For example, to use
            standard AES encryption, install Crypt::Rijndael and set
            data_cipher to Rijndael.

        4.3.2. /etc/init.d/ballastd (or equivalent)

            To invoke the server at boot time, the included systemd
	    .service and .socket files must be installed on a systemd host.
	    Once installed, ballast server can be managed with standard
	    systemctl commands, i.e.
	        systemctl enable ballast
		systemctl start ballast

            Alternatively, for non-systemd hosts an appropriate /etc/init.d
	    script and /etc/rc*.d links must be created.
            The server can simply be invoked as:

                /usr/local/sbin/ballastd

            Server behavior such as logging, invoking user and group,
            and the pid file can be configured in the /etc/ballastrc
            file.

            Note that the server runs with Perl taint mode enabled so if
            encrypted communication is enabled, a cipher X other than
            XXTEA_PP is used, and the corresponding Crypt::X module is
            installed in a non-standard location (i.e. not listed in
            @INC by "perl -V"), then the server must be invoked using:

                perl -T -I/module/location /usr/local/sbin/ballastd

        4.3.3. /var/spool/cron/crontabs/root (or equivalent)

            A root crontab may optionally be defined to collect stats on
            a periodic basis.  The ballastd --stats option takes a
            syslog stream on stdin and produces a set of result tables
            on stdout.

                # Collect daily Ballast usage stats at 8am and save in /dir
                #   (assumes syslog of previous day in /var/log/syslog.0)
                0 8 * * * /usr/local/sbin/ballastd --stats </var/log/syslog.0 \
                    >/dir/ballast.`/bin/date +%m.%d.%y`

            Depending on the Ballast and system logging configuration
            (i.e. where the log files go and how accessible they are),
            it may be possible to run this as a non-root user.


5. Activation

    Once Ballast has been configured, the server must be started.
    This is typically achieved through the corresponding "/etc/init.d"
    script:

        /etc/init.d/ballastd start

    Or it can be invoked directly:

        /usr/local/sbin/ballastd

    with the same caveat as mentioned in Section 4.3.2.

    The server configuration can be reloaded on-the-fly by sending the
    HUP signal to the ballastd process.  Note that the data_port setting
    cannot be modified in this manner and will crash the server if
    attempted.  Stop and restart to change this value.


6. Troubleshooting

    6.1. The balancer sends users to a different host every time it is invoked.

        All servers are down or cannot be contacted so the client has
        reverted to its default randomized strategy.  Check the status
        of the server(s) and restart, if necessary, as discussed in
        Section 5.

    6.2. The balancer sends users to the same host even though other
         hosts have clearly had lower load for more than a couple
         minutes.

        The agents on the other hosts are down or are unable to
        contact the server(s).  On each host, check that the agent has
        reported in to the server within the last five minutes (the
        server's view of when each host has last reported in can be
        shown by running "ballastd --dump :time" on the server).

        If the agent has not reported in, debug on each host with the
        following.

            - Check that cron is running.

            - Check that the agent crontab is installed as discussed
              in Section 4.1.2.

            - Check that the agent executable
              /usr/local/sbin/ballast-agent exists.

            - Check that the server port 4411 is accessible from the
              client host.

            - Check for execution errors by manually invoking
              /usr/local/sbin/ballast-agent as root and examining the
              output for errors.

    6.3. The balancer never sends users to a particular host

        The agent on that host may be down or unable to contact the
        server(s).  See above solution.

    6.4. The balancer reports that are hosts are unavailable even
         though they are not.

        The agents on all hosts are down or unable to contact the
        server(s).  See above solution.
