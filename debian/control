Description: Lightweight SSH load balancer supporting user-specific selection policies
 Ballast is a framework that was specifically designed for SSH load balancing by
 taking advantage of the aliasing and proxying capabilities available in most
 SSH clients. Within a traditional SSH bastion architecture, where internal
 resources can only be accessed from the outside via a hardened bastion system,
 Ballast is completely transparent to users and does not require any external
 modifications. Bastions and internal hosts must have the Ballast client and a
 pipe-based TCP relay utility such as netcat installed, which can be easily
 managed across internal hosts by configuration management tools.
 .
 Ballast consists of a Ballast agent on each balanced host, a Ballast server on
 one or more data servers, and a Ballast client on each bastion and internal
 host from which the user might access balanced hosts. The Ballast agent
 periodically collects system load information and sends it to the Ballast
 server. The server aggregates the load data received from all agents and stores
 it in a suitable form for making balancing decisions. When the user invokes SSH
 to a host alias designated for balancing, SSH triggers the Ballast client,
 which contacts the server to resolve balancing aliases to actual balanced host
 names. The server consults its data and returns one or more hosts, one of which
 the client connects to via netcat (or equivalent), after which the login
 proceeds normally.
 .
 Unlike traditional load balancers, Ballast has the ability to adjust its
 balancing strategy based on the invoking user. By tailoring system selections
 specifically to each individual user, the utility to each user can be maximized
 instead of choosing a system that may be best according to a common metric, but
 not ideal for the user's needs.
 .
 Ballast is in active production at the NASA Advanced Supercomputing Facility
 (https://www.nas.nasa.gov/hecc/support/kb/entry/233) and has handled over 75M
 balancing requests (as of May 2018) since deployment in June 2009.
